      <p id="comments">When  approaching Assignment Two I wanted to continue with the overarching concept of each week showing my progress learning and experimenting with code. In order to show my progression I wanted each week to have its own unique aesthetic that is complemented by the new code I have learnt/ implemented. The idea of each  having its own unique theme was extended to the "landing page" of Assignment Two as well. Initial when creating the landing page I wanted to incorporate a webcam effect and thatâ€™s when I landed upon an interesting filter in the P5 libraries for webcams using it as my starting point for the design.</p>
