    <p id="comments">Moving onto creating the webpages for week four I began by first deciding on the aesthetic quality/ theme for the pages under week 4, eventually landing upon this chrome visual identity. With the theme chosen week 4 I then tackled what interactive/ P5 elements I wanted to include into this portion of the design. Having only just really beginning to learn the various features and capabilities of P5 I started by using and taking inspiration from the code which we learnt in the class through the various activities, in particular the dot to dot and image load activities. </p>
