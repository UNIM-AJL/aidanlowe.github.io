      <p id="para1">Following on from the experimentation in week 4 and going into week 5 I wanted to continue exploring different features, functions and possibilities available through P5. In this process I again began looking at the examples available via the P5 library to see any cool effects, objects or possible interactions I could incorporate into the overall visual aesthetic for week 5. I eventually came across these various animated geometries which created this cool effect which I liked. Using these geometries as the basis I began experimenting with colour and decided upon this really bright a vibrant colours that were reminiscent of colours used in 90's video games.</p>
      <p id="para2">After establishing the colour palette I then proceeded to manipulate these geometries in regards to their the size, shape, angle, positioning and  lighting. Most of the geometrics I incorporated in my design I simply used as background imagery to make each make visually interesting, however, on the "home" page of week 5 I used these geometrics to serve as icons to denote for each individual section, bring a bit more interactivity to these object.</p>
