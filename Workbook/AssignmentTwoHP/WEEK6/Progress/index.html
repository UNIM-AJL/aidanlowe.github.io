    <p id="para1">When beginning the design process for week 6 I decided to take a more reserved approach in regards to the visuals and colours present on the page, grounding the webpage and moving away from the intense 3-dimensional object seen in week 4 and 5. I adopted a simply colour palette (red, white, grey and black) and decide to strip back the pages underneath week 6 to have a clean and direct visual emphasis as I felt that previous two weeks due to their ambiguous nature could be challenging for users to navigate. To start the design process I again looked through the P5 design library for any cool bit of code which I could experiment with, I came across this cool animated text spinning text which I began manipulating to fit my home page.

      <video src="inspo.mp4" id="shs" loop autoplay></video>
    </div>
    <p id="para2">Moving past the home page I wanted to start experimenting with sound  as we had just learnt about the capabilities of p5 to work with sound. To initially begin my experiments with sound and how I could incorporate it into my website I used the code which we had learnt in class and deconstructed/altered the code so that it would fit in within the visual identity I had established in the home page. This ultimately created this simplistic but interesting sound wave effect which I felt tied in well to the rest of the design for week 6.

      <video src="BeforeEdit.mp4" id="shs" loop autoplay></video>
      <video src="AfterEdit.mp4" id="shs" loop autoplay></video>
    </div>
    <p id="para3">In designing the activities section of week 6 I moved away from the p5 libraries and the weekly activities as a sources for inspiration instead turning to Youtube to look through various tutorial videos to see alternative ways in which sound can be experimented with. In this process I stumbled upon this tutorial that showed this unique sound effect that printed a circular faded imprint of the imbedded sound/ song. Liking the effect that was created I followed the tutorial to create my own version, however, upon finishing the tutorial I wasn't particularly happy with the results but in the process of experimenting with the code and I became interested with the white line in the centre that also reacted to sound. Isolating that element and expanding upon it I found that it created really interesting sound wave effect that reacted to the music being played in dynamic manner.</p>
