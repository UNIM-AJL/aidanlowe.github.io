                <p> Having built the basic website structure in the previous weeks I 
                    endeavoured to expand upon these pages adding more interactive elements
                    to encourage users to explore the various pages of the site. 
                </p>
                <p>Some of the elements I included into these webpages were more draggable objects,
                    videos, audio players and gifs.
                </p>
                <p>After expanding upon the three structural pages of the website I began 
                    creating the pages for three weeks under the assignment One folder. 
                </p>
                <p>In week one I wanted to create a very rudimentary page to represent not only 
                    the beginning of my coding journey and knowledge but also the original 
                    terminals that were used by coders in 60s and 70s. With this concept
                    in mind I kept all the features/ information on singular page employing the 
                    basic formate which was provided to us via the LMS coupled with a black and 
                    green colour palette, reminiscent of old coding terminals.
                </p>
                <p> The content on this page focused on highlighting the background 
                    history/information necessary for this subject as well as the description of what Interactive
                    media entails.</p>

                <p>Progressing onto week two I decided to take an unconventional approach to 
                    the structure of the page by having it chaotic and unorganised in nature.   
                </p>
                <p>The reasons why I took this approach was to really highlight my experimentation and 
                    how the cacophony of the code I've learnt if not structured and styled coherently 
                    ultimately leads to this orderless frenzied state.
                </p>
                <p>Week two also featured seperate html pages for the various topics within the week 
                    as way to give the main page more space to breath but also to give users more 
                    avenues to explore.
                </p>
                <p>Coming into the last week I wanted to move away from these inordinate webpages 
                    into a design that was more purposeful, sleek and visually cohesive. In order
                    to achieve this aesthetic I adopted a simple colour scheme of black, blue and 
                    white, endeavouring to keep the all the visual elements consistent. 
                </p> 
                <p>The webpages that resulted from this objective were simpler in nature when compared
                    to those of week two, however, the harmonious design of the week three webpages 
                    create an easier and more straightforward experience, ultimately leading to
                    a more effective interface.
                </p>
                <p>Whilst I was happy with the overall finished product of this assignment there are
                    still several aspects that could use more refined. One major aspect is the scaling 
                    when the webpages are shrunk down as some of the elements on the page become 
                    distorted and sometimes unusable. 
                </p>
                <p>Another issue is when the website is loaded up on mobile there is not only 
                    the same issues of elements on the pages becoming distored but also many of the 
                    features don't work such as the draggable elements.
                </p>
                <p> There were also several more minor issues that are present throughout the website 
                    that are a result of improper structure and inexperience in coding practises.
                </p>
                <p>In future tasks to resolve these issues I would need to start by coding the mobile 
                    interface first then convert it to desktop so that the website works at all scales
                    and dimensions, as well as organise my files in a more structure and catalogued 
                    manner avoiding these structural mistakes.
