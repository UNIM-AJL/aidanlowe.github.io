                <p>
                When constructing the mobile wireframes for my website I 
                decided to focus on four particular screens;
                </p>
                <p>- Assignments</p>
                <p> - Assignment One; Week One</p>
                <p> - Assignment One; Week Two</p>
                <p> - Assignment One; Week Three</p>
                <p>The reason why I chose these pages and not the 
                    home and subject page was that I felt that 
                    the home, subject and assignments webpages are all 
                    so similar that only one of the pages needed to be
                    adapted for mobile to show how it would be structured.
                </p>
                <p> Additionally, the reason I chose the other pages was 
                    because they were for one the main pages of the site 
                    and they were all unique different meaning they each 
                    required a specific structure to how they would need 
                    to look and act on mobile.</p>

                <p>Converting the assignments page to work in a mobile setting was
                    fairly straight forward when compared to the others as all 
                    I felt that I needed to do was to remove some of the interactive elements
                    to give the interface breathing room and shorten the description
                    of elements (e.g. Assignment One = A1) in order to make it readable 
                    on mobile interface.
                </p>
                <p>Assignment One Week One was slightly more harder to change as the 
                    side bar menu wouldn't work in a mobile environment as it would 
                    take a too much space leaving the interface crowded. To adapt this
                    menu to mobile I just made it a hamburger menu to free up space 
                    for the main column of the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>The webpage for Assignment One Week Two was by far the most challenging 
                    page to convert into a mobile setting as the interface that had been 
                    created was uniquely designed to be used in a desktop setting. In order 
                    to adapt this page to mobile I first had to get rid of all the items under 
                    inspirations and make another HTML page for it as it would crowd the page and
                    make it too chaotic for user to not only understand but also to explore. 
                    Furthermore, I had to re-shuffle most of the elements on the page so that 
                    they made sense on a mobile screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike Week two the main page for Assignment One Week Three was fairly 
                    straightforwards to alter. To have the webpage be effect in a mobile 
                    format I simply removed the top nav bar replacing it for a hamburger 
                    menu and then simplified the site further by removing the image leaning 
                    more into this simplistic sleek aesthetic.
                </p>
                <p>Overall I found converting my website to a mobile setting was actually 
                    quite challenging as I had only designed my website with desktop in 
                    mind not considering the limitations and restrictions that my designs 
                    would experience once they had be converted to mobile. However, despite 
                    this realisation I do believe it is possible to make my website work in a 
                    mobile setting I would just need to adjust structures of my website's pages
                    so they work effective in both mobile and desktop settings.
                </p>
                
                was uniquely make for desktop
                hard to cinvert
